question,context,answer
When did Propher Mohammed make hijra to Medina from Makkah?,"[1838.47 – 1840.63]  By the famous incident in that year.
[1841.51 – 1850.33]  The year of the elephant, let's say, right? The year of the drought, the year of this That's how they remembered years. Every year would have a particular title to it. So
[1850.72 – 1853.29]  the year of the Hijra became
[1853.68 – 1855.04]  Hijra, basically,
[1855.21 – 1858.16]  right? The year of the Hijra became our
[1858.94 – 1861.18]  year. The month of the Hijra,
[1861.34 – 1869.10]  yes, it is Rabbi al Awl most likely. The week of Rabbi al Awl most likely. The month of the Hijra is Rabbi al Awl, and
[1869.42 – 1870.54]  this corresponds
[1870.54 – 1871.82]  to September
[1872.11 – 1875.22]  of the year June.
[1875.22 – 1876.66]  So 06/22
[1876.66 – 1878.83]  is when one Hijra begins.
[1880.98 – 1884.03]  And already we already went over the story of the process of entering
[1884.53 – 1885.33]  Medina.
[1885.33 – 1892.29]  He entered Medina. Medina at that time was composed of, like most villages in places the world today,
[1892.61 – 1897.17]  there is not one center of gathering. There are small pockets of people

---

[  71.31 –   73.47]  who did the Hijra publicly
[  73.62 –   75.14]  except for Umar.
[  75.47 –   83.06]  I don't know of anybody who did the Hijra publicly except for Umar. Everybody was sneaking away, everybody was doing it in the middle of the night.
[  83.47 –   86.91]  Except for Umar ibn Al Khattab, he was the only Muslim
[  87.02 –   90.70]  to do the Hijra and make it public. He packed his bags,
[  90.94 –  104.06]  he armed himself and wore his, shield and his, arrows and everything, and he went to the Ka'aba and did tawaf seven times, and he's dressed as a traveler, he's prepared as a traveler, and then he makes a public announcement.
[ 104.23 –  105.83]  O people of Makkah,
[ 106.70 –  111.11]  whoever amongst you wishes that his mother lose him tonight,
[ 112.06 –  114.15]  or that his children become orphans,
[ 114.79 –  117.03]  or that his wife becomes a widow.
[ 117.59 –  123.27]  Then, know that I'm performing the hijrah and you can meet me outside of Makkah in such and such a valley.

---

[1735.24 – 1760.77]  And those who are the least concerned about hijrah and where to live because they're totally involved in sins, they're really the ones they shouldn't be living in environments where they pollute their iman, right? It's actually the opposite way around. Those who are the most worried should actually remain because they're the best ambassadors of the religion and those who are involved in every major sin and they couldn't care less, they need a pure environment, they should be thinking about a pure environment for themselves and their children.
[1761.17 – 1762.85]  In any case, getting back to the
[1763.97 – 1766.93]  the the seerah here and the and the
[1766.93 – 1770.21]  issue of the hijrah, we already mentioned that the prophet arrived
[1770.93 – 1773.10]  in Medina, now we don't have an exact date.
[1773.90 – 1776.30]  The date of the twelfth of by
[1776.30 – 1782.54]  the way, do understand as an academic, I have to point out, everybody loves to quote twelfth of the for
[1782.86 – 1783.50]  everything.","The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) made the Hijra to Medina from Makkah in the month of Rabīʿ al-Awwal, which corresponds to September of the year 622 CE. The specific date is not definitively established, but it is often associated with the twelfth of Rabīʿ al-Awwal.

</chat_history>","[3635.17 – 3646.69]  And therefore, from this story, we learned that the prophet and the sahaba, they returned back to Makkah probably two and a half years because some realize they say two, some say three. Probably around
[3647.28 – 3651.84]  the tenth year of the Dawah when the Prophet was around 49
[3651.84 – 3654.72]  years old, they finally returned to Makkah.
[3654.80 – 3659.44]  But unfortunately, as we'll discover soon, inshaAllah, as we continue, Allah tested
[3659.60 – 3660.24]  them with
[3660.95 – 3667.68]  some of the most traumatic and troubling tests and trials at this time, the death of Abu Talib, the death of Khadija,
[3667.68 – 3674.32]  and then the incident of Taif, one low after the other. This was the lowest period of the seerah of the prophet
[3674.43 – 3679.07]  and this will all be a precursor to the emigration to
[3679.23 – 3687.91]  Medina and that is something we will continue talking about later on. If there are any questions now, we can take them and then break for Al Aisha.
[3695.82 – 3698.55]  The
[3701.42 – 3704.54]  issue of Mi'raj, we will talk about inshaAllah as well later on.

[1782.86 – 1783.50]  everything.
[1783.82 – 1797.45]  For the birthday of the prophet for the time the Quran came down or the Wahi, which cannot be true because the Quran came down in Ramadan anyway. Right? But there are still some opinions that said, 12 is when came down, which is absolutely cannot be true because
[1797.86 – 1801.21]  came down in the month of Ramadan. Right? And
[1802.25 – 1805.45]  the 12 is when the prophet entered Madinah,
[1805.53 – 1807.85]  and this is a little bit of a superstition.
[1807.93 – 1813.40]  We don't know the exact date because nobody was recording calendars. Remember,
[1813.57 – 1817.64]  there was not even an Islamic calendar when all of this is happening. Remember,
[1817.81 – 1820.53]  Umat Ibn Khattab instituted a calendar,
[1820.68 – 1822.77]  you know, probably ten years after
[1823.40 – 1829.83]  the Hijjah More than ten years, sorry. Fourteen, fifteen years after the Hijjah of the Prophet So this is now being back tracked.
[1830.23 – 1838.15]  We are reading in the dates in terms of years. The years are not there. The months by the way are there. Remember how did they monitor time?

[1051.22 – 1054.02]  why did Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala choose Yathrib?
[1054.35 – 1055.87]  I mentioned seven points.
[1056.11 – 1061.30]  Actually, there's more than this, lecture only allows us seven. Every one of these seven points
[1061.55 – 1084.04]  is a reason why Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala chose Yathrib for our prophet, sallallahu alaihi wa sallam. He did not think of Yathrib. He did not desire Yathrib. Yathrib was not on his map. So much so, that when Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala showed him the land of Yathrib, there was no title on the dream, this is Yathrib. There was no subtitle, this is Yathrib. Allah showed him the date palms.","{ ""follow_ups"": [""What were the main challenges the Prophet faced during his time in Makkah?"", ""Can you explain the significance of the events in Taif?"", ""What were the reasons for choosing Medina as the new home for the Muslims?"", ""How did the deaths of Abu Talib and Khadija impact the Prophet's mission?"", ""What lessons can we learn from the trials faced by the Prophet during this period?""] }

[  94.66 –   99.14]  because it reminds us of the beauty of this religion, the simplicity of this religion.

[ 104.16 –  105.03]  advice

[ 131.34 –  147.08]  They all agreed the one most momentous incident in the Seerah was the Hijra. We should begin the Islamic calendar from the Hijra because that's when you can divide the Meccan era and the Madani era. That incident, the Hijra, our Prophet migrated
[ 148.04 –  149.72]  with his life literally
[ 149.72 –  150.68]  on the line,
[ 150.92 –  153.32]  being persecuted, almost assassinated,

---

[ 465.00 –  477.96]  up and running. So, financial independence. The Prophet stressed it from day one. Such that when other economies collapsed, it didn't affect the economy of Medina. Right? Big lesson for us to learn in the modern world.

[ 483.85 –  510.79]  as soon as the process of immigrated, one by one, the major commandments came down. Within a year, pretty much the entire Sharia of Ibadat had been revealed. Within a year, pretty much all of the of Islam except for Hajj. Hajj could not be revealed because you can't do Hajj, because Hajj is enemy territory. Right? So Hajj is revealed ninth year of the Hijra, Abu Bakr goes and does it, tenth year, the Prophet does it. Hajj was delayed. But the other pillars within,
