Here is the breakdown of other fields and information discovered through this feature:
Name: This field will contain the name of the monitor that is being discovered.
Serial #: The serial number of the discovered monitor.
Last seen on: The sync date when the monitor was last discovered/tracked.
Detected With: This is the IT asset that is attached to the discovered peripheral. For example, if a Macbook Air user has connected a monitor, that Macbook Air's information will be fetched for this field.
Custody: This field will give information on the user that IT asset was assigned to. In our case, it would give the name of the user that Macbook Air is checked out to.
Matches found: It would show the non-IT asset that matches the discovered asset on the basis of serial numbers.This field would be blank for all new monitors.
Merge with: This is a dynamic field and if there is a match found of the discovered monitor with a non IT asset, that match would be auto-populated in this column.

6. Setting up Organizational Units/Departments
Identify the organizational unit (one or more) where your AssetSonar users exist. All users in that organizational unit(s) will have access to AssetSonar, and any user outside the given organizational unit(s) won't be able to log in. If you have a nested OU structure (e.g. Branding Division being an OU, which has two sub-OUs Marketing and Finance) then all the sub-OUs also need to be listed. In this example, we'll list 3 OUs; Branding Division, Marketing, and Finance.
If you have User listings enabled, you can map OUs to your User listings (explained later in this blog). Otherwise, skip this step.
7. Defining LDAP attributes
To sync additional LDAP attributes with AssetSonar, you can define columns for them for mapping. See the image below:
Make sure to Save your Settings by scrolling down and hitting the 'Update' button.
Apart from all these, you can also map custom fields. To do so, select the 'Enable Custom Fields Mapping in LDAP' option. You will then see all the custom fields that you have created and can now map, as shown below:",Hello! I'm here to help you with any AssetSonar-related questions you might have.

Click on 'View' to see the changes in detail.
