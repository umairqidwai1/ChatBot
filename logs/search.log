Question: Can I import my users into the system

Context: Once your LDAP settings are in place, you can import the users from your AD using the Import button at the Members tab.
You can also sync (update) the AssetSonar members with your LDAP users, using the Update Existing Members option. The sync process can be automated by enabling the 'auto-syncing of users' setting at Settings \u2192 Add Ons \u2192 LDAP Server Integration.
You can provision Users from multiple sources whether manual or through LDAP into the system and can merge them as data gets updated so you can maintain the latest information on your users especially if they are added through spreadsheets. Merging will take place if the user is brought in through SAML, and/or manual entry (CSV or single port entry) and then merged via LDAP.
Note: A common issue for an unsuccessful import/sync process is not having Last Name and Email attributes configured in your LDAP server. Also, look out for invalid users' email addresses.
10. Advanced options
Settings \u2192 Add Ons \u2192 LDAP Server Integration has the advanced options.

---

12. Importing users to Custom Roles
You can also import your users and their respective roles in a way that their hierarchy is reflected in AssetSonar using our third-party integrations. To do so, select the 'Import Users to Custom Roles' option under each of the following settings:
LDAP Server integration (https://ezo.io/assetsonar/blog/integrating-ldap-server-with-assetsonar-deece8be5a90/)
G Suite integration (https://ezo.io/assetsonar/blog/g-suite-integration-de4ac8256ee9/)
SCIM-based integrations with OneLogin (https://ezo.io/assetsonar/blog/scim-for-onelogin-dceb6917f195/), Azure AD (https://ezo.io/assetsonar/blog/scim-for-azure-ad-f21c5707af1/), and Okta (https://ezo.io/assetsonar/blog/scim-user-provisioning-820ed93288a0/)
Below, we use LDAP as an example.
Once you have checked the setting, the following options would appear on the attribute and column mapping table:
Note: If the data values for Roles and Teams are not already specified in AssetSonar, the users belonging to these Roles and Teams will not get provisioned into AssetSonar. You will receive an email listing the users that could not be provisioned.

---

You'll be able to see a preview of all the members to import. Hit the 'Import Members' button. Your AssetSonar account now includes a comprehensive log of all your employees.
Note: All members imported from the Google Workspace directory will be assigned the default role of a Staff User, and the following Default Member Settings will apply to them.
To change the default member settings, head to Company Settings \u2192 Member Settings \u2192 Default Member Settings, and configure the settings based on your preference.
2.1. Importing users to Custom Roles
If you want to map your users and their respective roles (https://ezo.io/assetsonar/blog/custom-roles-26d7dfd8fe1b/) so that their hierarchy is reflected in AssetSonar, you can do so by checking the 'Import Users from G Suite as Custom Role' option. You will be able to map the attributes as shown below:
Note: If the data values for Roles and Teams are not already specified in AssetSonar, the users belonging to these Roles and Teams will not get provisioned into AssetSonar. You will receive an email listing the users that could not be provisioned.

Answer: Yes, you can import users into AssetSonar. The platform supports importing users from various sources, including LDAP, G Suite, and SCIM-based integrations with systems like OneLogin, Azure AD, and Okta. You can also import users manually via CSV or single port entry. Make sure to configure the necessary settings for the integration you choose, and ensure that attributes like Last Name and Email are correctly set up to avoid import issues.

Question: Can I import my users into the system

Context: Once your LDAP settings are in place, you can import the users from your AD using the Import button at the Members tab.
You can also sync (update) the AssetSonar members with your LDAP users, using the Update Existing Members option. The sync process can be automated by enabling the 'auto-syncing of users' setting at Settings \u2192 Add Ons \u2192 LDAP Server Integration.
You can provision Users from multiple sources whether manual or through LDAP into the system and can merge them as data gets updated so you can maintain the latest information on your users especially if they are added through spreadsheets. Merging will take place if the user is brought in through SAML, and/or manual entry (CSV or single port entry) and then merged via LDAP.
Note: A common issue for an unsuccessful import/sync process is not having Last Name and Email attributes configured in your LDAP server. Also, look out for invalid users' email addresses.
10. Advanced options
Settings \u2192 Add Ons \u2192 LDAP Server Integration has the advanced options.

2.1. Types of actions on stock requests
From the Purchase Order Details page, an Admin can approve or deny a stock request for Inventory. Following are the four actions that an Admin can take:
A. Approving and confirming POs
This enables an Admin to approve a stock request placed by a Staff User and send the PO to the 'Confirmed: Items Pending' state (Note: You cannot add more items to this PO once you approve and confirm it). You can now receive items against this PO.
After items are received, this PO will either be sent to the Payment Pending or Completed state.
B. Approving and adding items to your Product Catalog
This option enables an Admin to approve a stock request placed by a Staff User and send the PO to the Confirmed: Payment Pending state.
Note: You cannot add more items to this PO once you approve and confirm it.

---

In our case, we are choosing Trigger Webhooks. It is an action that will inform another system when an automation event has happened in Assetsonar. The other systems can then call AssetSonar's API to fetch the data or start any actions on their own system. With Trigger Webhooks, you'll also have to add a callback URL in the designated field.
For authentication, you will get three options:
Click on 'No Authentication' if you don't have any authentication criteria.
2. Clicking on 'Basic Authentication' will require you to provide a username and password as shown below:
3. The third option is to choose the API key. You'll have to enter the header key and header value.
Once you have filled out all the designated fields, click on save to create the new automation. It would start showing up on the automations detail page.
Automation Placeholders
While creating an automation, you can copy data from one field and map it to another. If you don't want to set specific values for a field, you can insert a placeholder instead. You'll just have to choose a placeholder field and copy the value from that field.

Answer: The context provided does not explicitly list all possible actions you can perform via the AssetSonar API. However, it does mention that you can use the API to integrate with systems like Cisco Meraki and to trigger webhooks for automation events. These actions suggest that the API can be used for:

- Integrating with third-party systems.
- Fetching data from AssetSonar.
- Starting actions in other systems based on events in AssetSonar.

For a detailed list of all possible API actions, you might want to refer to the AssetSonar API documentation or contact their support team at support@ezo.io.

2.1. Types of actions on stock requests
From the Purchase Order Details page, an Admin can approve or deny a stock request for Inventory. Following are the four actions that an Admin can take:
A. Approving and confirming POs
This enables an Admin to approve a stock request placed by a Staff User and send the PO to the 'Confirmed: Items Pending' state (Note: You cannot add more items to this PO once you approve and confirm it). You can now receive items against this PO.
After items are received, this PO will either be sent to the Payment Pending or Completed state.
B. Approving and adding items to your Product Catalog
This option enables an Admin to approve a stock request placed by a Staff User and send the PO to the Confirmed: Payment Pending state.
Note: You cannot add more items to this PO once you approve and confirm it.

In our case, we are choosing Trigger Webhooks. It is an action that will inform another system when an automation event has happened in Assetsonar. The other systems can then call AssetSonar's API to fetch the data or start any actions on their own system. With Trigger Webhooks, you'll also have to add a callback URL in the designated field.
For authentication, you will get three options:
Click on 'No Authentication' if you don't have any authentication criteria.
2. Clicking on 'Basic Authentication' will require you to provide a username and password as shown below:
3. The third option is to choose the API key. You'll have to enter the header key and header value.
Once you have filled out all the designated fields, click on save to create the new automation. It would start showing up on the automations detail page.
Automation Placeholders
While creating an automation, you can copy data from one field and map it to another. If you don't want to set specific values for a field, you can insert a placeholder instead. You'll just have to choose a placeholder field and copy the value from that field.

Answer: The context provided does not explicitly list all possible actions you can perform via the AssetSonar API. However, it does mention that you can use the API to integrate with systems like Cisco Meraki and to trigger webhooks for automation events. These actions suggest that the API can be used for:

2.1. Types of actions on stock requests
From the Purchase Order Details page, an Admin can approve or deny a stock request for Inventory. Following are the four actions that an Admin can take:
A. Approving and confirming POs
This enables an Admin to approve a stock request placed by a Staff User and send the PO to the 'Confirmed: Items Pending' state (Note: You cannot add more items to this PO once you approve and confirm it). You can now receive items against this PO.
After items are received, this PO will either be sent to the Payment Pending or Completed state.
B. Approving and adding items to your Product Catalog
This option enables an Admin to approve a stock request placed by a Staff User and send the PO to the Confirmed: Payment Pending state.
Note: You cannot add more items to this PO once you approve and confirm it.

In our case, we are choosing Trigger Webhooks. It is an action that will inform another system when an automation event has happened in Assetsonar. The other systems can then call AssetSonar's API to fetch the data or start any actions on their own system. With Trigger Webhooks, you'll also have to add a callback URL in the designated field.
For authentication, you will get three options:
Click on 'No Authentication' if you don't have any authentication criteria.
2. Clicking on 'Basic Authentication' will require you to provide a username and password as shown below:
3. The third option is to choose the API key. You'll have to enter the header key and header value.
Once you have filled out all the designated fields, click on save to create the new automation. It would start showing up on the automations detail page.
Automation Placeholders
While creating an automation, you can copy data from one field and map it to another. If you don't want to set specific values for a field, you can insert a placeholder instead. You'll just have to choose a placeholder field and copy the value from that field.

Answer: The context provided does not explicitly list all possible actions you can perform via the AssetSonar API. However, it does mention that you can use the API to:

For example, as an IT company or IT department of a company, you probably send your hardware out for maintenance fairly often since failure to do so would result in a loss of time and money.
However, once an asset is out for maintenance, its unavailability will most likely disrupt your work plans.
In such a situation, it would be helpful if you could view which assets are unavailable and when their maintenance is expected to complete. This way, you can efficiently plan your work accordingly around the unavailability of such assets, thereby avoiding any loss of time.
To help you with this scenario, it would make sense for you to choose KPIs such as 'Assets in Maintenance' or 'Assets Maintenance Ending Today' to display on your Dashboard.
2. Customize the Dashboard
The Dashboard offers you greater customizability because you now have the power to choose which KPIs you want to view.
You can also choose where to place the KPI cards and for what custom time period you want to display the metrics. We'll show you how to do all this, and more, as we move ahead.

You can provide a name for your scheduled report. Let's say the IT manager would like to see a weekly report on assets available. They can name the report 'Weekly Asset Report'. They can also choose the users who will receive this report via email.
Next, choose the repeat frequency for sending the report. It can be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. In our case, we've set it to one week.
You can also provide starting and ending dates for sending out the report. Let's say the manager needs a weekly report for the first quarter. They can select 1st Jan as the starting and 31st Mar as the ending date as shown above. Also, there's an option to choose a company-defined time or a different time to send out the report.

Answer: Hello! I'm just a virtual assistant, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to help you with any AssetSonar-related questions you might have. How can I assist you today?
2025-05-16 11:49:11,941 [INFO] HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-16 11:49:14,237 [INFO] History context: Question: What Are the possible actions we can do via API

Context: Now you'll be able to see the details page of API and Webhooks. Here is a snippet of what this page looks like:
3. Go to the 'API Keys and access' tab and you'll be able to view the already generated API keys. You can copy and paste one of these to your AssetSonar's integration setting or you can create a new key if you have not already created two keys.
Please note that Cisco Meraki allows you to create only two API keys simultaneously. In order to create a third one, you'll have to revoke one existing API key.
Once you enter the API key in your AssetSonar setting, you'll be able to set up the integration. You'll also be able to view and take actions on additional Cisco Meraki integration setting options.
From these additional settings, you can either choose to import all organizations and networks or you can select certain organizations and certain networks within them. Within one organization, there can be multiple networks. You can create multiple organizations from within your Cisco Meraki account.

2.1. Types of actions on stock requests
From the Purchase Order Details page, an Admin can approve or deny a stock request for Inventory. Following are the four actions that an Admin can take:
A. Approving and confirming POs
This enables an Admin to approve a stock request placed by a Staff User and send the PO to the 'Confirmed: Items Pending' state (Note: You cannot add more items to this PO once you approve and confirm it). You can now receive items against this PO.
After items are received, this PO will either be sent to the Payment Pending or Completed state.
B. Approving and adding items to your Product Catalog
This option enables an Admin to approve a stock request placed by a Staff User and send the PO to the Confirmed: Payment Pending state.
Note: You cannot add more items to this PO once you approve and confirm it.

In our case, we are choosing Trigger Webhooks. It is an action that will inform another system when an automation event has happened in Assetsonar. The other systems can then call AssetSonar's API to fetch the data or start any actions on their own system. With Trigger Webhooks, you'll also have to add a callback URL in the designated field.
For authentication, you will get three options:
Click on 'No Authentication' if you don't have any authentication criteria.
2. Clicking on 'Basic Authentication' will require you to provide a username and password as shown below:
3. The third option is to choose the API key. You'll have to enter the header key and header value.
Once you have filled out all the designated fields, click on save to create the new automation. It would start showing up on the automations detail page.
Automation Placeholders
While creating an automation, you can copy data from one field and map it to another. If you don't want to set specific values for a field, you can insert a placeholder instead. You'll just have to choose a placeholder field and copy the value from that field.

Answer: The context provided does not explicitly list all possible actions you can perform via the AssetSonar API. However, it does mention several capabilities:

- **Integration with Third-Party Systems**: You can use the API to integrate with systems like Cisco Meraki, allowing you to import organizations and networks.
- **Trigger Webhooks**: You can set up webhooks to notify other systems when an automation event occurs in AssetSonar. These systems can then call AssetSonar's API to fetch data or initiate actions.
- **Authentication Options**: The API supports different authentication methods, including no authentication, basic authentication, and API key-based authentication.

For a comprehensive list of all possible API actions, it would be best to refer to the AssetSonar API documentation or contact their support team at support@ezo.io.

Question: List all the integrations available

Context: 2. Enable Mosyle Business Integration
To enable the integration, please go to Settings \u2192 Integrations \u2192 Mosyle Business Integration and select 'Enabled'.
Once enabled, you can view an option to add your Mosyle Business credentials to set up the integration. Click on the option 'Add Credentials' and the following dialog box will appear asking you to enter the Access Token, Username, and Password and hit 'Add'.
Now click on Update to finish creating the integration. Once your integration is enabled, you can pull up your iOS and MacOS data from Mosyle Business.
3. Sync devices with Mosyle Business
To import your Mosyle Business data to AssetSonar, click on the 'Sync Now' button that appears after integration is enabled.  You can also set up automated syncs between Mosyle Business and AssetSonar by clicking on the 'Schedule sync every 24 hours' option.
4. View asset information
From the asset listing page, you'll be able to view all the devices that have been imported from Mosyle Business to AssetSonar. To get a list of these devices, click on the filter button on the asset listing page, and choose the 'Last Sync Source' filter.

- **Mosyle Business**: For syncing iOS and MacOS data.
- **OneLogin**: For importing software applications and associated user data.

For a complete list of integrations, you might want to check the AssetSonar website or contact their support at support@ezo.io.

Question: how is you day?

For example, as an IT company or IT department of a company, you probably send your hardware out for maintenance fairly often since failure to do so would result in a loss of time and money.
However, once an asset is out for maintenance, its unavailability will most likely disrupt your work plans.
In such a situation, it would be helpful if you could view which assets are unavailable and when their maintenance is expected to complete. This way, you can efficiently plan your work accordingly around the unavailability of such assets, thereby avoiding any loss of time.
To help you with this scenario, it would make sense for you to choose KPIs such as 'Assets in Maintenance' or 'Assets Maintenance Ending Today' to display on your Dashboard.
2. Customize the Dashboard
The Dashboard offers you greater customizability because you now have the power to choose which KPIs you want to view.
You can also choose where to place the KPI cards and for what custom time period you want to display the metrics. We'll show you how to do all this, and more, as we move ahead.

---

You can provide a name for your scheduled report. Let's say the IT manager would like to see a weekly report on assets available. They can name the report 'Weekly Asset Report'. They can also choose the users who will receive this report via email.
Next, choose the repeat frequency for sending the report. It can be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. In our case, we've set it to one week.
You can also provide starting and ending dates for sending out the report. Let's say the manager needs a weekly report for the first quarter. They can select 1st Jan as the starting and 31st Mar as the ending date as shown above. Also, there's an option to choose a company-defined time or a different time to send out the report.

Here is the breakdown of other fields and information discovered through this feature:
Name: This field will contain the name of the monitor that is being discovered.
Serial #: The serial number of the discovered monitor.
Last seen on: The sync date when the monitor was last discovered/tracked.
Detected With: This is the IT asset that is attached to the discovered peripheral. For example, if a Macbook Air user has connected a monitor, that Macbook Air's information will be fetched for this field.
Custody: This field will give information on the user that IT asset was assigned to. In our case, it would give the name of the user that Macbook Air is checked out to.
Matches found: It would show the non-IT asset that matches the discovered asset on the basis of serial numbers.This field would be blank for all new monitors.
Merge with: This is a dynamic field and if there is a match found of the discovered monitor with a non IT asset, that match would be auto-populated in this column.

6. Setting up Organizational Units/Departments
Identify the organizational unit (one or more) where your AssetSonar users exist. All users in that organizational unit(s) will have access to AssetSonar, and any user outside the given organizational unit(s) won't be able to log in. If you have a nested OU structure (e.g. Branding Division being an OU, which has two sub-OUs Marketing and Finance) then all the sub-OUs also need to be listed. In this example, we'll list 3 OUs; Branding Division, Marketing, and Finance.
If you have User listings enabled, you can map OUs to your User listings (explained later in this blog). Otherwise, skip this step.
7. Defining LDAP attributes
To sync additional LDAP attributes with AssetSonar, you can define columns for them for mapping. See the image below:
Make sure to Save your Settings by scrolling down and hitting the 'Update' button.
Apart from all these, you can also map custom fields. To do so, select the 'Enable Custom Fields Mapping in LDAP' option. You will then see all the custom fields that you have created and can now map, as shown below:
